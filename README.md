## Introduction
--- 
This is a project to develop an eBPF program that utilizes tc-bpf to act as a statefull ingress FW and to redirect 
ingress ipv4 udp/tcp flows toward dynamically created sockets that correspond to zero trust based services on OpenZiti
edge-routers. Those interested on how to setup an openziti development environment should visit 
https://github.com/openziti/ziti. 
Also note this is eBPF tc based so interception only occurs for traffic ingressing on the interface that the eBPF program
is attached to. To intercept packets generated locally by the router itself the eBPF program would need to be attached to
the loopback interface. The eBPF program also provides stateful inbound firewalling and only allows ssh, dhcp and arp
bypass by default. Initially the program will allow ssh to any address inbound however after the first tproxy mapping is
inserted by the map_update tool it will only allow ssh addressed to the IP address of the interface that tc has loaded the
eBPF program.  All other traffic must be configured as a service in an OpenZiti Controller which then informs the edge-router
which traffic flows to accept. The open ziti edge-router then uses the map_update user space app to insert rules to
allow traffic in on the interface tc is running on. For those interested in additional background on the project please visit: 
https://openziti.io/using-ebpf-tc-to-securely-mangle-packets-in-the-kernel-and-pass-them-to-my-secure-networking-application.

Note: While this program was written with OpenZiti edge-routers in mind it can be used to redirect incoming udp/tcp
traffic to any application with a listening socket bound to the loopback IP. If you are testing without OpenZiti the
Destination IP or Subnet must be bound to an existing interface on the system in order to intercept traffic. For
external interface IP(s) this is taken care of.  If you want to intercept another IP that falls into the same range as
the physical interface then you would need to add it as a secondary ip.  Subnets won't work for binding on the external
interface it needs to be a host address. Subnets will work on the loopback however. OpenZiti binds intercept 
addresses/prefixes to the "lo" interface i.e. sudo ip addr add 172.20.1.0/24 dev lo scope host. I've added similar
functionality with the -r,--route optional argument. For safety reasons this will only add a IP/Prefix to the loopback
if the destination ip/prefix does not fall within the subnet range of an external interface.

The latest release allows for source filtering.  This comes at the cost of limiting the number of filters that a packet
could match i.e.  if you have /32, /24, /16 and /8 rules all of which match the incomming packet from a source cidr / dest
cidr but differing port rules then if the port match in the /8 rulte then the packet would be dropped since the
program would never reach that search depth.

## Management After Deployment

### Attaching to interface

```bash   
sudo tc qdisc add dev <interface name>  clsact
sudo tc filter add dev <interface name> ingress bpf da obj tproxy_splicer.o sec action
sudo ufw allow in on <interface name> to any
```

ebpf will now take over firewalling this interface and only allow ssh, dhcp and arp till ziti
services are provisioned as inbound intercepts via the map_udate app. Router will statefully allow responses to router
initiated sockets as well. tc commands above do not survive reboot so would need to be added to startup service / script.

### Openziti Ingress

Testing with ziti-router after attaching. Build a ziti network first and create services as explained at [Host It Anywhere](https://docs.openziti.io/docs/learn/quickstarts/network/hosted/)

Grab the edge router binary `(>= v0.27.3)` at [open ziti](https://github.com/openziti/ziti/releases).

```bash
# Copy the user space map program to folder in $PATH i.e
sudo cp map_update /usr/bin

# In the router config.yml set tunnel mode to ebpf i.e.   
- binding: tunnel
  options:
    mode: tproxy:/path/to/map_update

# Run edge router command 
# Note: assumption - ziti-router and config.yml in PATH
sudo ziti-router run config.yml
```

### Detaching from interface:

```bash
sudo tc qdisc del dev <interface name>  clsact
```

## Ebpf Map User Space Management
---
Example: Insert map entry to direct SIP traffic destined for 172.16.240.0/24

```bash
Usage: ./map_update -I `<ip dest address or prefix>` -m `<prefix length>` -l `<low_port>` -h `<high_port>` -t `<tproxy_port>` -p `<protocol>`

sudo ./map_update -I -c 172.16.240.0 -m 24 -l 5060 -h 5060 -t 58997 -p udp
```

As mentioned earlier if you add -r, --route as argument the program will add 172.16.240.0/24 to the "lo" interface if it
does not overlap with an external LAN interface subnet.

Example: Insert map entry to with source filteing to only allow rule for ip source 10.1.1.1/32.

```bash
Usage: ./map_update -I -c `<ip dest address or prefix>` -m `<dest prefix len>` -o `<origin address or prefix>` -n `<origin prefix len>` -l `<low_port>` -h `<high_port>` -t `<tproxy_port>` -p `<protocol>`

sudo sudo ./map_update -I -c 172.16.240.0 -m 24 -o 10.1.1.1 -n 32  -p tcp -l 22 -h 22 -t 0
```

Example: Insert FW rule for local router tcp listen port 443 where local router's tc interface ip address is 10.1.1.1
with tproxy_port set to 0 signifying local connect rule

```bash
sudo ./map_update -I -c 10.1.1.1 -m 32 -l 443 -h 443 -t 0 -p tcp  
```

Example: Monitor ebpf trace messages

```
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe

<idle>-0       [007] dNs.. 167954.255416: bpf_trace_printk: tproxy_mapping->22 to 39839

```
Example: Remove previous entry from map
```bash
Usage: ./map_update -D -c `<ip dest address or prefix>` -m `<prefix len>` -l `<low_port>` -p `<protocol>`

sudo ./map_update -D -c 172.16.240.0 -m 24 -l 5060 -p udp
```

Example: Remove all entries from map
```
Usage: ./map_update -F

sudo ./map_update -F
```

Example: List all rules in map
```
Usage: ./map_update -L

sudo ./map_update -L

## Additional Distro testing
---

Fedora 36 kernel 6.0.5-200

On fedora I found that NetworkManager interferes with eBPF socket redirection and can
be unpredictable so belowis what I changed to get it working consistently. Other less
intrusive methods not requiring removal of NM might also be possible.

```bash
sudo yum install network-scripts
sudo systemctl enable network
sudo yum remove NetworkManager

sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

# if eth0 will be dhcp then something like:
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes

# or if static
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.61.70
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
DEVICE=eth1
ONBOOT=yes
```

The following grub change is only necessary on systems that do not use ethX naming by
default like vmware. this changes fedora back to using ethX for interface naming network-scripts looks for this nomenclature and will fail DHCP otherwise

```bash 
sudo vi /etc/default/grub

# change:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.lvm.lv=fedora_fedora/root rhgb quiet"

# to:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.lvm.lv=fedora_fedora/root rhgb quiet net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0"

# then:
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```
This updates dhcp script to dynamically update systemd-resolved on per interface resolver

```bash
sudo vi /usr/sbin/dhclient-script

# change:
if [ -n "${new_domain_name_servers}" ]; then
    for nameserver in ${new_domain_name_servers} ; do
        echo "nameserver ${nameserver}" >> "${rscf}"
    done

# to:   
if [ -n "${new_domain_name_servers}" ]; then
    for nameserver in ${new_domain_name_servers} ; do
        echo "nameserver ${nameserver}" >> "${rscf}"
        systemd-resolve --interface "${interface}" --set-dns "${nameserver}"
    done
````

## Deployment on Ubuntu
---
Since ebpf programs are not persistent over reboots, one needs a way to re-attach them to interfaces. We created a bash script to be run at boot time, and it is also triggered by ziti-router systemd service when it is restarted. Both are located under the files directory.
1. [tproxy_splicer_startup.sh](./files/scripts/tproxy_splicer_startup.sh)
1. [ziti-router.service](./files/services/ziti-router.service)

The script is created with comments, so hopefully the comments will help readers understand what is happening. One thing to pay attention to is `lanIf`. The `lanIf` option is configred in the ziti-router configuration file evey time either tproxy with iptables or ebpf is configured. 
```bash
# Here is the code snippet from the script:
MYIF=$(cat /opt/netfoundry/ziti/ziti-router/config.yml |yq '.listeners[] | select(.binding == "tunnel").options.lanIf')
```
As one can see we lookup lanIf (i.e. `.options.lanIf`) in the config.yml file located in the ziti-router directory. Based on that port everyting else is configured for the ebpf program to work. We also look up the fabric, edge, and health-check ports to update the tproxy map to allow these ports in along with `DNS UDP Port 53`.
